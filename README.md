# Overview

You are flying your ship out in the asteroid belt trying to clear the way for your colony ships to make it through without being destroyed. Take your ship and clear the space rocks from the path to ensure your race will continue.
Use the arrow keys to direct your ship. Use the spacebar to shoot the space rocks to dust.

I created this game to blow off steam when you are furustrated with life or a project. It is something you can get lost doing without having to think about anything but destroying the next object.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
